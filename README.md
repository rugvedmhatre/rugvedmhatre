## Here are a few things I have worked on...
- [Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/Multimodal-Sentiment-Analysis) - This project explores different methodologies, focusing on fusion techniques that integrate information from three modalities (audio, language, vision) to enhance sentiment analysis performance, and the various architectures that employ them.

- [Continual Learning for Autonomous Vehicles](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/Continual-Learning-for-Autonomous-Vehicles) - Applying the continual learning framework to Autonomous Vehicle setting: predicting steering angles based on the captured images. Experimented with various approaches - Elastic Weight Consolidation, Experience Replay and Temporal Consistency Regularization.

- [ResNets](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/ResNet) - Explored ResNet Models trained to classify images on CIFAR-10 dataset. Finetuned hyperparameters, experimented with ResNet depths and strategies like dropout layers and learning rate schedulers acheiving a test accuracy of 95.37%.
